# slackbot-martin

slackbot-martin is a chat bot built for use in the team's private Slack channel, and runs on a Raspberry Pi web server.

The team's intention is to provide greater interaction inside the Slack channel by providing additional functionality, as well as to gain additional use from the Pi.

Below is a list of current methods we've implemented thus far:

* <b>"Animate"</b>
- Get a random animated gif from the internet based off of a query.
- <u><i>animate &lt;user's choice of query words&gt;</i></u>
